Iggy Azalea First things first, I'm the realest (realest)
Drop this and let the whole world feel it (let 'em feel it)
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm givin' lessons in physics (right)
You should want a bad bitch like this (ha)
Drop it low and pick it up just like this (yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist (on my wrist)
Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that (never)
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back (what)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spillin', you should taste that
